## Workflow
First off, create a new branch:
```bash
git pull
git checkout -b "iss(issue-id-number)"
```
Next, write your code and:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "commit message"
```
Iterate the above for changes you make.

At the end of the day/session, push your work to git:
```bash
git pull
git push
```

When you are done with the issue create a pull-request here at Github to close the branch
